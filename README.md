# flow-wabot
A simple Wolfram Alpha bot for Semaphor.

Edit: bot_name, bot_ping, app_key in wabot.py

You can also edit 'responses.csv' if you want different responses when wabot can't find an answer.

## TODO

- Read variables in from a file instead of editing wabot.py directly.
- Handle non-text responses from WolframAlpha.
- Error handling/reporting.
- More conversational responses (yes/no answers, etc)

## NOTE:

This bot has NOT gone through a security review.
